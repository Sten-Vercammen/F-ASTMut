# step 2: build project with export compile commands:
cd minitest
mkdir build
cmake _DCMAKE_EXPORT_COMPIILE_COMMANDS=ON ..

#step 3: extract files you want to mutate:
jq --compact-output ‘[.[] | .file]’ compile_command.json

#step 3b: if present (useually not), remove test files such as the test/main.cp one

#step 4: go to README of TOOL to continue
